## 🟠 🫐 Introduction to the Game Concept


### Welcome to our new game project, where players will step into a thrilling world filled with vampires, 🦇 bats, and skeletons 💀!

This game is designed to give players an engaging experience reminiscent of classic adventure titles like Zelda, but in a simpler format **suitable for beginners**.

> #### Players will navigate through a beautifully crafted world, interacting with various objects and enemies, while honing their skills in combat and exploration.

#### The main objective is to defeat enemies by shooting 🔫 them, avoiding obstacles, and uncovering secrets within the game.

## 🟡  Transitioning to Advanced Game Development Concepts

In this project, we’ll introduce new concepts that differentiate it from our previous space shooter game.

> #### One key feature is the use of IDs to reference player positions.

> This means that each element in the game whether it’s the **player, an enemy, or an object** will be assigned a **unique identifier (ID)**.
