## ðŸŸ¡ Environment creation

- Each game project will have different modules to install

<br>
<br>

#### 1. Within your /Project folder, create:

- -  `.gitignore` file, add this: **.myvenv**



#### 2. Within your /Project folder, create:

- - `test.py` (or whatever you want to call it)

#### 3. Within your /Project folder, Create the Environment:

ðŸŒˆ **In your terminal:** Check if you are in your **/Project** (this is important) because I am going to install some modules (I only want them installed in that specific project)

<br>

 - - CREATE the **environment:** Type this in your project terminal `python -m venv .myvenv`

 <br>

- - ACTIVATE the **environment:** Type this in your project terminal `source .myvenv/bin/activate`

<br>

#### 4. Verify activation:

>Once ACTIVATED (you should see the `(.venv)mycomputer@usercomp:~/YOURPROJECT/`) , if you dont see the venv its not activated.

<br>
<br>

### ðŸ”´ Remember that the modules you install in each project is different

<br>

#### 5. ðŸ§¶ Install Modules: PYGAME:

<br>

- - INSTALL this:   `pip install pygame`

- - Then Install:  `pip install pygame-ce`
`


<br>

- After installing your first module, generate the `requirements.txt` file to see the packages you've installed. This is different from **pip list**, which displays the installed modules in the terminal but does not create a file.

```python
# type this to generate the requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

```



<br>
<br>

#### 6. VERIFY the installation

- - VERIFY the installation: Type this in your project terminal `pip list`

```bash
