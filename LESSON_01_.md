## 🟡 Vampire survivor

 <br>


## 🟦 Intro

### Following our successful creation of the  ["Space Shooter"](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/python-intro-2024-privat/blob/master/z_PYgame/spaceship_game/RE_game-CODE_17_Debut-game_create_Sounds.md) game in Pygame, we've established a foundational understanding of game development.

> #### Now, we are ready to embark on our second project, which promises to be more immersive and complex.



<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟠 What We will be doing:

### In this project, we will explore several key concepts essential for building a more sophisticated game.


#### 🍭 Specifically, we will focus on the following four areas:

- - Collision Detection

- - Camera Control

- - Level Creation with an Editor

- - Animation Control

🟤 **Collision Detection:** Understanding how to detect collisions between game objects is crucial.

>   #### We will learn various techniques to manage interactions, such as when a player character encounters an enemy or picks up an item.

 This will enhance gameplay by providing feedback and consequences for player actions.

<br>

🟤**Camera Control:** A dynamic camera system can significantly improve the player's experience by providing a better view of the game world.

>   #### We will explore how to implement a camera that follows the player, ensuring that the action remains centered while also allowing for smooth transitions and zooming effects.

<br>

🟤**Level Creation with an Editor:** Building levels manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.

>   #### We'll dive into creating a level editor that allows us to design and modify game environments easily.

>   This will enable us to focus on creativity and gameplay design, making the development process more streamlined.

<br>

🟤**Animation Control:** Proper animation is vital for bringing characters and environments to life.

>   #### We will learn how to manage animations effectively, including creating smooth transitions between different states (e.g., walking, jumping, attacking) and synchronizing them with game  mechanics.

# 🟦 Lets get started

## 🟡 1. Project Setup

**Visit the official page** [code-projects/5games](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/5games) and download the default project folders for the Vampire Game.

#### Once downloaded, add these folders to your **repository**.

<br>

## 🟡 2. Checking Folders

🟤 Before diving into the game development, **take some time to explore each folder** where images are stored.

Here’s what you should look for:

### 🟤 Images Folder:

This folder contains images for the various characters, you will find them inside folders such as: player, enemies, gun.

>#### Each image typically corresponds to different actions or directions, such as:

- down

- left

- down.left

- up

> #### Some images may be ✋ numbered for various animations ( enemies).

<br>

###  🟤 Tiles Folder:

An important folder containing the tile images used for the **game's background** and environment.
