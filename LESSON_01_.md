## 🟦 Intro

### Following our successful creation of the  ["Space Shooter"](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/python-intro-2024-privat/blob/master/z_PYgame/spaceship_game/RE_game-CODE_17_Debut-game_create_Sounds.md) game in Pygame, we've established a foundational understanding of game development.

> #### Now, we are ready to embark on our second project, which promises to be more immersive and complex.



<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟠 What We will be doing:

### In this project, we will explore several key concepts essential for building a more sophisticated game.


#### 🍭 Specifically, we will focus on the following four areas:

- - Collision Detection

- - Camera Control

- - Level Creation with an Editor

- - Animation Control

🟤 **Collision Detection:** Understanding how to detect collisions between game objects is crucial.

>   #### We will learn various techniques to manage interactions, such as when a player character encounters an enemy or picks up an item.

 This will enhance gameplay by providing feedback and consequences for player actions.

<br>

🟤**Camera Control:** A dynamic camera system can significantly improve the player's experience by providing a better view of the game world.

>   #### We will explore how to implement a camera that follows the player, ensuring that the action remains centered while also allowing for smooth transitions and zooming effects.

<br>

🟤**Level Creation with an Editor:** Building levels manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.

>   #### We'll dive into creating a level editor that allows us to design and modify game environments easily.

>   This will enable us to focus on creativity and gameplay design, making the development process more streamlined.
